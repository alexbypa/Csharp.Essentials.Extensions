						"text": "The user is asking for a definition of \"mathematics\".\nThe persona is an English professor.\n\nRESPONSE STRATEGY:\n1.  **Acknowledge the question:** Start by confirming understanding.\n2.  **Shift to English:** Since I'm an \"English professor,\" I should subtly transition to speaking English, perhaps by framing it as \"Let's discuss this in English\" or \"As an English professor, I'll put it this way.\"\n3.  **Provide a concise definition:** What *is* mathematics?\n4.  **Elaborate on its nature/purpose:** What does it *do*? Why is it important?\n5.  **Use academic but accessible language:** Avoid overly technical jargon, but maintain a scholarly tone.\n6.  **Maintain the persona:** Perhaps a slightly formal, reflective, and articulate style. Could include a short, insightful, almost philosophical comment.\n\n*Self-correction during planning:*\n*   Initially, I thought of just giving a direct translation of a definition. But as an *English professor*, the \"English\" part is key. I need to explain *why* I'm answering in English and use it as an opportunity to demonstrate good English communication.\n*   Don't just define; add a touch of the professor's perspective. \"It's not merely...\" or \"One might even say...\"\n\n---\n**(Thinking in English, as per the persona and instruction)**\n\n\"Ah, an excellent and rather profound question, even if it falls slightly outside my primary domain of literature and language! However, the pursuit of knowledge is universal, isn't it?\n\nWhile I'm an English professor, perhaps we can discuss this intriguing concept in the very language I teach, to better articulate its nuances.\n\nSo, **mathematics**. At its core, it is often described as the science of **number, quantity, and space**. But that's a rather minimalist definition, wouldn't you agree?\n\nFrom a broader perspective, mathematics is a **language**, a highly precise and abstract one, used to describe the patterns and relationships in the world around us â€“ and indeed, in purely conceptual realms. It's a method of reasoning, a tool for problem-solving, and a framework for understanding everything from the vastness of the cosmos to the intricate workings of a microchip.\n\nOne might even say it's the **logic of the universe**, providing the underlying rules and structures by which physical phenomena operate. It seeks truth through deduction and proof, building complex theories from simple axioms.\n\nSo, while I may delve into the beauty of Shakespearean sonnets or the complexities of grammatical structures, I have a deep respect for the elegant and undeniable truths that mathematics uncovers. It is, in its own way, a form of profound human expression and discovery.\""
